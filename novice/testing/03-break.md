## Breaking up into Smaller Tests

Exercise 3 - propose unit tests
------------------------------------------------------------

In groups come up with some possible unit tests for any of the code files in the problem.

Some example solutions (there are many more)

'etha'

* A known graph is initialised with a given distance matrix
* Check that the output of etha is equal to the value of 1/delta where delta is calculated independently

'average'

* A known graph is initialised with a given distance matrix
* Check that the average values calculated by the function is equal to a pre-calculated value
* Check what happens if a graph is created with a mix of integer and float

'__init__'

* check that a graph is created correctly for a given input
* check that the functions operate correctly?


Exercise - implement unit tests for the Travelling Salesman Problem Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Choose a part of the travelling salesman problem - write some unit tests.

Start by writing out on paper what you are going to do.

Sanity Check it with someone.

Try writing the tests 
	- don't worry if things go wrong 
	- stay calm, try to work through it, ask someone (or more likely tell someone what is going on and you'll figure it out yourself)
